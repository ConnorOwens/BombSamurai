# BombSamurai
A simple Android game that relies on quick reflexes for success<br/>
The player is faced with slashing the bombs in half before the fuse goes out<br/>
Each bomb either has to be sliced horizantally or vertically based on the line on the bomb<br/>
As the game continues, the fuse of the bomb lasts shorter, making it more challenging<br/>
When a bomb explodes, the player will be greeted by the fully-functional game over screen, showing the their score and the high score<br/>
